Memory Usage
------------


     

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'U2/tone2_3__N_199'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will
     not respond to the reset signal 'U2/tone2_3__N_199' via the GSR component.

     Components with synchronous local reset also reset by asynchronous GSR

     These components have the GSR property set to ENABLED and the local reset
     is synchronous. The components will respond to the synchronous local reset

     GSR component.
